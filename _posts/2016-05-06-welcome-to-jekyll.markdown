#### Solo website now running

Hosted on github.com/solo-system/solo-system.github.io, and served by
jekyll, this website is now live.  It is also full of errors and
ommisions.  But it works.

{% highlight c %}
int main(){
    int i,j;
    for (i = 0 ; i < NDIM ; i++){
    	printf("%i is possibly prime\n", i);
    }
    exit 0
}

{% endhighlight %}
