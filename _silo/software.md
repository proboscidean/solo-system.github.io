Solo Software Images: available here

Solo Software Images: available here
If you are using the CLAC (Cirrus Logic Audio Card), be sure to download the file with clac in the name. If you are using a USB microphone (the Blue Snowflake), choose the file without “clac” in the name.
Once the solo software image has downloaded it should be flashed onto an empty SD-card using your PC, prior to being used in a Solo.  Follow the instructions here [HOLE].  The integrity of the download can be verified by checking it against the README.txt file
The Solo Software Image contains all the software the Solo needs in order to perform the recordings.
Advanced users can change the Solo’s default configuration using the amon.conf file. [HOLE]
