To assemble a Solo:CLAC you will need:

power supply (any usb-micro power supply will do).  I'm using a power
bank.  A raspberry pi A+ (or B+).  the Clac.  The piface shim RTC, with battery.

1) install the clock onto the Raspberry Pi

Insert the battery (CR33300033).
Locate the correct orientation, push down

2) Install the CLAC on the raspberry pi (over the clock).  get
orientations right as in the photo.  Notice the 2 plastic columns and
4 little plastic screws.  Install as shown.  Plastic screws are easily
over-tightened.

3) That's the hard bit done - put all your tools away.

4) plug in the microphone (pink socket)
5) plug in the SD card (preflashed)
6) attach power.

Notice it booting, and heartbeat.
