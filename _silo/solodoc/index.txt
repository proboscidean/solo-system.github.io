Solo Documentation
==================

This is a collection of documentation for the Solo field recorder.

There is a [FAQ](faq.html), a good starting point.

There is an [assembly guide](assembly-guide-usbmic.html) for the
USB-mic Solo, using the Blue Snowflake microphone - a well tested setup.

There _should_ be an [assembly guide](assembly-guide-Cirrus.html) for
the Cirrus version of the Solo (which uses the Cirrus Logic Audio
Card, which supports any microphone with a standard 3.5mm jack).

A discussion of [hardware clocks](hardware-clock.html), so that your
Solo knows the time, and can label the audio files sensibly.

And there is a [User Manual](usermanual.html), to guide an operator
through deployment, recovery of the Solo, including preparing the
SD-card, and subsequently harvesting data from it.

And they are all beautifully presented, aren't they.
