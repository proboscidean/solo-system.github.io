looking at primo capsules.

[used to be FEL - "front end lift" - they do inline 20db gain PIP amps]

very common is:

-------------------

EM172 omni directional electred capsule.  Requires PIP to work.
Cost: £12.00 (short B+R wires)
Ultra low noise | High Sensitivity
Wide Dynamic range | Omni Directional

Primo EM172-Z1 Microphone Capsule

    Omni directional (non-directional)
    Signal to Noise ratio 80dB (Self Noise 14dBA) (jdmc2:very low noise!)
    Also available with short wires pre-soldered
    Sensitivity -28 dB (+/- 3dB at 1kHz, 0dB=1V/Pa)
    -28dB/Pa = 39mV/Pa (added jdmc2)
    Operating Voltage 3 V (2-10 V)
    Maximum input Sound Pressure Level 119 dB
    Diameter 10 mm, depth 4.5 mm, Weight 0.9 grammes.


Superb quality electret condenser mic capsule, its extraordinarily low
noise and high sensitivity makes this ideal for recording nature
sounds, backgrounds and ambiences.

wired to 3.5mm plug: mono/stereo (balanced)  21.50 / 41.00 
screened 1.5m cable.  Plug by "Rean".

Primo EM173 Electret Condenser Microphone
£13.50

    High sensitivity Electret Condenser Microphone.
    Ultra low noise, Wide dynamic range (108db), High quality.
    10 mm diameter. 
    3 wire connection


The EM172-Z1 and EM173 are physically identical, they share the same
housing and diaphragm.

The EM172 has a 2 wire connection and is the easiest to use, it can be
wired directly directly to most domestic recorders which have 3.5 mm
microphone sockets and supply plug in power.

The EM173 has a 3 wire connection, its the 3 wire version of the
EM172. It has no internal resistor from the source to ground, if you
add a 100 ohm resistor between source and ground on the EM173 its
identical to the EM172, of course you can select a higher value for
less sensitivity.
