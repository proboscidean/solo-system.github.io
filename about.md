The Solo was developed to solve a need within our own project to have
a servicable field recorder that was cheap and easy in remote overseas
locations.  In africa

It was important that the device was:

* Inexpensive - broken eaten by monkey
* Servicable in-situ.
* no returns from rainforest / customer service.
* no configuration at field site (installation point).
* versatile (any microphone, any battery etc...)
* affordable to projects and organisations in poor countries.
* modular - so you can cannibalise broken components together to get them working again.

And once it was useful to me, it was useful to others, so I opened it
up - it's now open source.

The solo is under active development.  If you can code - look at the
github site.  If you have ideas or a request for new functionality,
please leave a comment on our facebook page.  If you have a success
story, let us know.

Solo was developed by James Christie (info@solo-system.org) and
adopted early for field use by Robin Whytock.
