The Solo was developed to solve a need within our own project to have
a servicable field recorder that was cheap and easy in remote overseas
locations.  In West African rainforest, where importing hardware is
difficult and costly, and returning broken hardware for servicing is
prohibitvely bureaucratic.

It was important that the device was:

* Inexpensive - don't care if it's dropped, grabbed by ape, or stolen by hunter.
* Servicable in-situ.
* availability: built from consumer components (as far as possible)
* no returns from rainforest / customer service
* no configuration at field site (installation point)
* versatile (any microphone, any battery etc...)
* affordable to projects and organisations in all countries
* modular: broken units can be repaired and maintained

And once it was useful to me, it was useful to others, so I opened it
up - it's now open source.

The Solo is under active development.  If you can code - look at the
github site.  If you have ideas or a request for new functionality,
please leave a comment on our facebook page.  If you have a success
story, let us know.

Solo was developed by James Christie (info@solo-system.org) and
adopted early for field use by Robin Whytock.
