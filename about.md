# About

The Solo was developed to solve a need within our own project to have
a servicable field recorder that was cheap and easy in remote
locations (West African rainforest), where importing hardware is
difficult and costly, and returning broken hardware for servicing is
prohibitvely bureaucratic.

It was important that the device was:

* inexpensive - so we don't care if it's dropped, stolen or trampled.
* servicable in-situ - assume no access to customer service / returns.
* availabe - components are available as widely as possible.
* no configuration at point of installation (settings can be changed in the lab/office, and don't need to be set in the field).
* versatile (any microphone, any battery etc...)
* affordable to projects, people and organisations of all sizes in all countries
* modular: broken units can be repaired and maintained.
* modifiable, tailorable, extensible - you can make changes to hardware and software to suit your needs.

Although the Solo has been in use for a few years, it remans under
active development to keep up with new hardware and software.
