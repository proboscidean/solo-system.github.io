# Device

Every Solo is built from roughly the same components: a mini-computer,
microphone, with data being stored on a memory card. It is protected
by a weatherproof enclosure, and powered by a battery.

However, there is a lot of flexibility with the individual components
of the Solo, so it can be tailored to your particular needs.


## Solo:Basic

Throughout much of this site, we will refer to the `Solo:Basic` - a
clearly defined set of hardware components that give you a good solid
working solo, that fulfills most needs.

### Capabilities of Solo:Basic

The Solo Basic records continuously for 5.5 days using the USB
powerbank which fits inside the enclosure.  It uses the Primo EM172.Z2
microphone, and a 64Gb memory card.  A more detailed bill-of-materials
is in the [getting started](/documentation/getting-started.html)
guide, but here's a quick list:

* Mini-computer: Raspberry Pi (model A+) 
* Audio board: Cirrus Logic audio card
* Clock module: PiFace shim RTC clock module
* Battery: EC powerbank 22.3mAh USB battery bank
* Memory card: 64Gb micro SD memory card
* Microphone: Primo EM172 microphone
* Enclosure: DriBox 300 waterproof enclosure

The Solo basic is easy to assemble - head to the [getting
