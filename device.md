The Solo comprises of a mini-computer, microphone, with data being
stored on a memory card. It is protected by a weatherproof enclosure.

TODO: photo of Solo in the field.

There is a lot of flexibility with the individual components of the
Solo, so it can be tailored to your particular needs.  Here we
will describe a typical configuration: the 'Solo Basic'.

The Solo Basic records continuously for 5.5 days.  It comprises:

* Mini-computer: Raspberry Pi (model A+) 
* Audio ADC: Cirrus Logic audio card.
* Clock module: PiFace shim RTC clock module
* Battery: EC powerbank 22.3mAh USB battery bank
* Memory card: 64Gb SDmicro memory card
* Primo EM172 microphone
* DriBox 300 enclosure

# The physical Solo (hardware)

There's lots of flexibility in building a physical Solo, depending on
your needs.  Enclosures, waterproofing, power options, microphone -
they are all up to you.

All Solos will need the core electronics, an enclosure to waterproof
it, a battery or power supply, a microphone, and a memory card.

The memory card initially has only the solo software on it, is where
the audio files are stored.


## Solo Basic hardware.

Here is a good starting point - the __Solo Basic__.

The solo basic runs for 5 days (round the clock) on a simple USB
battery pack, uses a 32Gb Memory card, a simple enclosure and a "Primo
EM172" Microphone Capsule.  The audio is recorded at 16kHz


All solos are based around a Raspberry Pi and a Sound Card (the cirrus
logic audio card) Software for all solos is the same.  But the
hardware is quite versatile with lots of flexibility.



Here is the Platonic Solo. (solo-basic?)
