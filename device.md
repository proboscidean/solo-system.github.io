# Device

Every Solo is built from roughly the same components: a mini-computer,
microphone, with data being stored on a memory card. It is protected
by a weatherproof enclosure, and powered by a battery.

However, there is a lot of flexibility with the individual components
of the Solo, so it can be tailored to your particular needs.


## Solo:Basic

The `Solo:Basic` is a standardised system that gives you a good solid
working Solo that will fulfill most needs.

## Capabilities

It will record continuously for 5.5 days using the USB powerbank which
fits inside the enclosure, and produce mono, 16kz, 16 bit audio files,
each 10 minutes long, each one labelled with the time it was recorded.

## Components

A more detailed bill-of-materials
is in the [getting started](/documentation/getting-started.html)
guide, but here's a quick list:
