This document covers Configuring the Solo to your particular needs

NOTE: The default settings of the Solo work well in most situations.
If you have built the Solo:basic, they work perfectly.  The easiest
thing to do is to change __nothing__ in the configuration.  Just flash

flashing a memory card with the SSI.  The memory
