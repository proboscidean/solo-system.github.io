FIELD GUIDE
===========

Field deployment:
-----------------

You will need: 

  * SOLO unit
  * Charged battery
  * Flashed SD card  (see appendix 1)

	
Steps:
------
1. Ensure that microphone is plugged into minicomputer via the USB
   cable

2. Connect the power cable to the minicomputer (do not connect the
   battery yet)

3. Insert the (flashed) SD card into the minicomputer (take care with orientation)

4. Place the minicomputer into the waterproof enclosure.

5. Attach the battery. 

6. Do it once, with confidence, and do not unplug again once it has
   started. This automatically turns on the minicomputer - you should
   notice a solid red light on the minicomputer, and a flashing green
   light. The green light will eventually (1 minute) settle to a
   ‘heart-beat’ double flash pattern, and which point the device is
   actively recording

7. Place the battery into the box next to the minicomputer and pack
   securely.

8. Close the waterproof enclosure - taking care not to pinch the
   microphone cable.

9. Mount the microphone and waterproof box as desired (mount
   microphone horizontally to avoid water ingress).


Field recovery
--------------

1. (This step is only necessary if the SOLO is still running).  Power
   off the SOLO by depressing the red button on the minicomputer for 2
   seconds.  Notice the green heart-beat change, and finally stop with
   10 deliberate flashes.  The SOLO is now off

2. Unplug the battery from the power cable

3. Remove SD card and store safely (and label it)

4. Replace SD card and/or battery if you are leaving the equipment in
   the field to continue recording, following the steps in ‘Field
   deployment’
