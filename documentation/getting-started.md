## Solo-basic - getting started

### Purchasing components:

These are the components needed to build the Solo-basic:

* [Raspberry Pi model A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a-plus/)

* [Cirrus Logic Audio Card](http://nowhere/)

* [PiFace Clock](http://www.piface.org.uk/products/piface_clock/) buy: [farnell/UK](http://uk.farnell.com/piface/shim-rtc/real-time-clock-shim-for-raspberry/dp/2434226)

* [Watch Battery (CR1220)](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=CR1220) Generic part, widely available.

* Memory Card - any micro-SD format card.  More [here](/documentation/memory_cards/)

* [Primo microphone](http://www.primomic.com/products/pdf/EM172.pdf) (I know - how man go do?) You can buy them in the UK [here](http://micbooster.com/primo-microphone-capsules/65-clippy-em172-microphone.html#/matched_capsules-mono)

* [USB battery bank](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?keywords=ec+technology+powerbank)

* [Waterproof Enclosure](http://dri-box.com) I suggest version [200](http://dri-box.com/size-option/size-200)

* [Little Box](https://www.westonboxes.com/collections/business-card-boxes-1/products/deep-business-card-box)


### Apology:

I haven’t written these instructions properly yet - sorry. There is a really heartless go at it below, but writing documentation is soul-destroying when you don’t know if anyone will read it. Then it’s a joy (and I get a proof-reader for free).So if you want it, do ask.

### Video

There is a video of this: TODO YouTube link.

### Assembly: Once you have all the parts, you can assemble the Solo:

* Locate all the components needed.
* Place the battery into the clock module (positive side up)
* mount clock module on the raspberry pi
* mount the Cirrus Logic Audio Card on the Raspberry Pi (+ attach screws).
* Attach microphone to the pink socket on the Cirrus Logic Audio Card
* attach the power cord to the Raspberry Pi (but not a power source yet)
* That’s it. There is a video

Note: If you have no money or lack commitment, the [Solo-cheapskate]
version might be for you. (forget the microphone, forget the clock,
forget the battery). Cheapskate. It’ll hook you - then you’ll be back.
