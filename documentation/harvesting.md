# Harvesting

This document covers harvesting audio from a memory card that has previously been in a deployed Solo.

After being in a deployed Solo, the audio card is full of audio data
(and a few log files) which should now be copied to a
PC/laptop/desktop computer.

You should physically insert the card into a "card reader" which may
be integrated into your PC or might be a seperate component that
connects to your PC via USB.

Once the card is connected, the PC will recognise the card, and the
audio will become available to copy.  You should ensure that you have
sufficient storage on your PC to handle all the audio data files
(Solos can collect a LOT of data).

Once you have copied the data, you should consider the contents of the
memory card to be redundant, and you should reflash the card. Deleting
the audio and re-using the card in a solo again might work, but is not
recommended.  Always Use a freshly flashed memory card when you
prepare a Solo.

Depending on your computer's operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux),
slightly different procedure is needed.

### Windows

### Mac

Just plug it in, and a drive called "solo-audio" will appear.

### Linux

Just plug it in, and a parition called "solo-audio" will appear.
