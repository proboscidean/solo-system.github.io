# Documentation

## [Getting Started](/documentation/getting-started.html).

This guide is the first thing to read.  It's a good quick start guide
to Solo, and the Solo:Basic.


## Documentation Tree:

Although this section may have cross-links, the whole thing is tree
structured, so you can read it all (and know you have done so).

* [configuration](configuration.html) - configuring Solo for different situations (sample rate, stereo/mono, timezone, etc...)
* [power](power/) - information about batteries and power consumption
* [microphones](microphones.html) - plug sizes, stereo/mono, gain/volume etc.
* [memory cards](memory_cards/) - choosing the right memory card (size/speed/shape)
* [enclosures](enclosures.html) - waterproofing the Solo
* [flashing](flashing.html) - how to prepare a memory card for use in a Solo
* [harvesting](harvesting.html) - how to copy audio data from memory card to your PC
