# Memory cards.

All memory cards used in the solo must fit into the Raspberry Pi.  The
physical format must be micro-SD.

The Raspberry Pi can handle SDHC and SDXC cards (this includes pretty
mucy every card you'll ever see).

## Capacities

micro-SD cards come in sizes up to (currently 256Gb).  You need to
balance: how long you want to record for, and what your audio settings
(sample rate, stereo/mono).


| Card Capacity | Sample Rate | channels | duration |
|---------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| one           | two         | three    | four     |
| Aone          | Atwo        | Athree   | Afour    |
|---------------|-------------|----------|----------|
