## Software

The SOSI (Solo operating system image) is needed to run every
Solo. It's available free [here](www.solo-system.org/sosi/) to
download.

### Flash - don't copy


Remember to [flash](/documentation/flashing.html) the SOSI onto the memory card, don't just drag-and-drop it - that will __not__ work.



### Configure (perhaps remove this - it's a tthe end of the flash section)

After  flashing the memory card, you can change the default recording behaviour to different sample rates.  See [documentation/Configuration](/documentation/configuration.html)
