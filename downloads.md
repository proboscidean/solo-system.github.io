## Software

The SOSI (Solo operating system image) is needed to run every
Solo.  The image must be [flashed](/documentation/flashing.html) onto the memory card as detailed in the [Getting&nbsp;Started](/documentation/getting-started.html) guide.




It's available free to
download [here](www.solo-system.org/sosi/).




After flashing the memory card, advanced users can change the default recording behaviour to different sample rates.  See [configuration](/documentation/configuration.html) for more.
