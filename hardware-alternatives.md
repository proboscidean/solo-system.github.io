All Solos are based on the same core minicomputer (Raspberry Pi). All
use the same SSI (solo software image). Any USB power source will
work. The microphone choice is very dependent on the particular
deployment, and therefore we try to support as many microphone types
as possible.

Microphones
-----------

USB microphones are uncomplicated – they plug directly into the USB
socket on the minicomputer, and are easy to configure and set input
levels. In USB microphones, both the microphone receiver and the ADC
(analog-to-digital converter) is combined into a single unit. Good
success has been achieved with the Blue Snowflake microphone. Here’s
information on the Solo with Snowflake.

Power supply

Memory cards

Audio card. Also well supported is the Cirrus Logic Audio Card –
which, once physically attached to the Raspberry Pi, allows any
standard 3.5mm microphone to be used.Separate audio-USB dongles are
available like: Icicle (XLR to USB). None are supported
out-of-the-box, but are usually easy to add. Consideration should be
given to their power consumption
