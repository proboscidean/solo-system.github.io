The Solo is an autonomous outdoor recorder for unattended
environmental monitoring. Battery operated and enclosed in a
weatherproof enclosure, it comprises a microphone, mini-computer and
battery.  It is tailored for long-term, continuous recording, with
data being stored on a removable memory card.

[![what is this](/img/naked-solo-on-table.jpg "inside a solo" ){:.some-css-class style="width: 60%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; margin-left: 10px; float: right"}](/img/naked-solo-on-table.jpg)

The Solo is designed to be modular, simple to use and inexpensive. The
components are easy to buy, and it's easy to assemble. All software is
open and free.

A typical deployment would be powered by a USB battery bank which
would run the system for five days of permanent recording, 24 hours
per day.  A 12Kg car battery recently powered a Solo for over 40 days.

Recording is split into manageable 10-minute-long files which are
stored on the memory card - grouped into an intuitive folder-per-day
layout.  The recordings are in the .wav format which is compatible
with almost all audio software.

It is simple to prepare (flash) the memory card with the software to
run the Solo, and just as easy to harvest the audio data onto your
desktop/laptop using a card reader.  All software is free to download
and licensed openly.

The basic Solo system is straightforward to assemble, and inexpensive
compared to comparable commercial systems. A basic Solo costs around
120 pounds, including a battery, memory-card and a really good
microphone.  But there's a lot of flexibility with components if you
are picky.
