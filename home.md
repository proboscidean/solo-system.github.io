The Solo is an audio recorder for unattended, long-term, continuous
environmental monitoring.

The Solo comprises of a mini-computer, a microphone and battery, with
data being stored on a memory card.  It is protected by a weatherproof
enclosure.

A typical deployment would be powered by a standard USB battery bank
which would run the system for five days of permanent recording.  A
12Kg car battery recently powered a Solo for over 40 days.

Recording is split into manageable 10-minute-long files which are
stored on the memory card - grouped into an intuitive folder-per-day
layout.  The recordings are in the .wav format which is compatible
with almost all audio software.

It is simple to prepare (flash) the memory card with the software to
run the Solo, and just as easy to harvest the audio data onto your
desktop/laptop using a card reader.  All software is free to download
and licensed openly.

The basic Solo system is straightforward to assemble, and inexpensive
compared to comparable commercial systems. A basic Solo costs around
120 pounds, but there's a lot of flexibility with components like
microphones, memory cards, batteries etc...
