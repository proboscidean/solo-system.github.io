# What is it for

The SOLO is an autonomous outdoor audio recorder for unattended,
long-term, and continuous environmental monitoring.


# What it comprises

The SOLO comprises of a microphone, mini-computer and battery, with
data being stored on a SD card. It is protected by a weatherproof
enclosure. Typical deployment would be from a standard USB power bank
which would run the system for 5 days of permanent recording. Solar,
deep-cycle battery, mains or vehicle powering are all possible,
although not currently supported. Recording is split into manageable
10-minute sections, further split into folder-per-day layout. Larger
SD-cards allow longer recording times, with 32Gb cards able to hold
around 13 days (64Gb hold 27 days). Audio is stored uncompressed in
standard “.wav” format. Audio sample rate is user-configurable – 16kHz
and 44.1kHz are common choices.

Preparing (flashing) the SD card with the software to run the SOLO and
any user-configuration, and later harvesting the audio data from the
SD-card onto a PC, is simple. Consideration should be given to data
storage back in the office, and a plan for analysis of bulk data is
recommended. The Solo produces a lot of audio data.

The basic SOLO system is straightforward to construct, and inexpensive
compared to comparable commercial systems. The SOLO basic costs around
80 UKP; 120 UKP with waterproofing and some luxuries. Upgrading
microphones and batteries is all possible if desired.

This webpage is intended to demonstrate how to construct and run a
SOLO. In addition, instructional videos are available on a YouTube
channel here, and comments are welcomed on our Facebook page here.
